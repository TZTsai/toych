# A simple digit OCR program

A neural network implemented from scratch is trained by the MNIST dataset to gain some ability to classify handwritten digits. Try to write a digit on the webpage and see if it predicts the correct answer!

## How to use

Run `python main.py` and wait for the neural network training (only needed during the first launch). Then open localhost:8000 in a web browser to play with it.
